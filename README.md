A node module interface to the PayPal REST APIs. Currently only supports payments.

**This is a developer preview. Please note that it is for example purposes only and is unsupported.**


## Installation 

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm link
```


## Disclaimer

Yes, I acknowledge there are no tests. This was intended for use with the [PayPal CLI](https://github.com/jeffharrell/paypal-cli) and that has test coverage. One day if I have time...
